/**
 * WhatsApp Business Platform (Cloud API) adapter. Same Meta App as
 * facebook.js/instagram.js (META_APP_ID/SECRET) — WhatsApp Business
 * scopes are requested from the same OAuth dialog, no separate app.
 *
 * WhatsApp has no "posts" the way Facebook/Instagram do — it's a
 * messaging-only channel, so unlike those adapters this one has no
 * publish/fetchAnalytics/fetchPostCount/fetchPosts. That's fine: queue.js's
 * processJob and routes/social.js's postCountForAccount/analytics summary
 * already check `typeof adapter.X === 'function'` before calling, so an
 * account connected here just won't show up as a Composer target or in
 * Analytics' per-post view — Composer.jsx additionally filters whatsapp
 * out of its account picker explicitly, since "schedule a broadcast post"
 * isn't a real WhatsApp Business operation the way it is for the other
 * platforms (outbound messages here are either a reply within an open
 * customer conversation, or a pre-approved template message, which this
 * adapter doesn't build).
 *
 * What this adapter does provide is conversation messaging: sendReply()
 * for outbound, and inbound messages land via a webhook (see
 * routes/social.js's /social/webhook/whatsapp), not a poll — the Cloud
 * API has no "list all conversations" endpoint the way Messenger's
 * /page-id/conversations does, so fetchInbox() here is a stub (same
 * reasoning as instagram.js's for Instagram DMs) and pollers.js's sweep
 * never actually finds new messages this way; the webhook is what
 * populates inbox_messages for whatsapp, in real time as messages arrive.
 *
 * Setup: on the same Meta App as Facebook/Instagram, add the "WhatsApp"
 * product, with a WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) that already has at
 * least one verified phone number set up in Meta Business Suite (this
 * adapter connects to an existing WABA/number — it doesn't run Meta's
 * Embedded Signup flow to create one). Add this redirect URI:
 *   {BACKEND_PUBLIC_URL}/api/social/callback/whatsapp
 * and, under the app's WhatsApp > Configuration > Webhook settings:
 *   Callback URL: {BACKEND_PUBLIC_URL}/api/social/webhook/whatsapp
 *   Verify token: WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN (.env)
 *   Subscribe to: messages
