/**
 * Shared OAuth + Graph API helper for the two Meta-family adapters
 * (facebook.js, instagram.js) — same role as _google-oauth.js for
 * youtube.js/google-business.js: one Meta App (META_APP_ID/SECRET)
 * covers both, since Instagram publishing/reading goes through the same
 * Graph API using the linked Facebook Page's access token, not a
 * separate Instagram-specific OAuth app.
 *
 * Meta has no refresh_token the way Google does. Instead:
 *   1. The OAuth code exchanges for a short-lived user token (~1-2h).
 *   2. That's immediately exchanged for a long-lived user token (~60d).
 *   3. The long-lived user token is used to fetch a Page access token,
 *      which inherits that ~60d validity and is what gets stored as
 *      social_accounts.access_token — Graph API calls for a Page (and
 *      its linked Instagram Business Account) use the Page token
 *      directly, not the user token.
 * "Refreshing" here means re-running step 2 on the still-valid long-lived
 * user token before it expires, then re-deriving a fresh Page token —
 * see refreshAccessToken() in facebook.js/instagram.js. If the user
 * token has already fully expired, this fails and the account needs a
 * fresh OAuth connect (same as any platform whose refresh window is
 * missed entirely).
 *
 * Meta App Review note (build spec section 6, Phase 2): pages_manage_posts
 * and instagram_content_publish require App Review before they work for
 * anyone other than the app's own Meta developer/testers in Development
 * Mode. This code is written and worth testing against your own
 * dev-mode Page/Instagram Business Account now; it won't work for real
 * third-party users until that review is approved.
