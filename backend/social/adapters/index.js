/**
 * Registry of social platform adapters — the social-module equivalent of
 * server.js's `const ADAPTERS = { db1, db2, ... }`. routes/social.js and
 * scheduler.js only ever go through this map, never a platform-specific
 * require, so adding facebook.js/instagram.js/linkedin.js/pinterest.js in
 * a later phase is a one-line addition here and nowhere else.
 *
 * Phase 1 registered youtube + google_business; Phase 2 added facebook +
 * instagram; Phase 3 adds linkedin (personal-profile posting only — see
 * linkedin.js's header on why Company Page posting isn't included yet).
 * x is still unregistered — a valid `platform` value in the schema, but
 * blocked on external approval per the build spec, so any route touching
 * it 404s with a clear "not available yet" rather than crashing.
